# Detection_of_DoS_Attacks

In this project, we have taken a data set that consists of Server IP addresses (of the user and destination), the data transmission speed and memory, the time of the source presence, etc. The data set comprised a total of 23 attributes that are required for detection of a DDoS attack.

We put this data through several Machine Learning Algorithms to successfully detect a DDoS attack and come to a conclusion as to which of the algorithms yields a higher accuracy.
The project was operated on KNN method, Logistic Regression, Na√Øve Bayes, and clustering methods like, K means method, Hierarchical clustering. 
In the end the maximum precision was attained in KNN method.
